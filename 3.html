  <h2>OLED</h2>
  <p>
    An organic light-emitting diode (OLED or organic LED), also known as organic electroluminescent (organic EL) diode,
    [1][2] is a light-emitting diode (LED) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of
    organic compound that emits light in response to an electric current. This organic layer is situated
    between two electrodes; typically, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used
    to create digital displays in devices such as television screens, computer monitors, portable systems such as smartphones,
    handheld game consoles and PDAs. A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices
    for use in solid-state lighting applications.[3][4][5]
